## ⚙️ About These Files

This repo contains my **NixOS dotfiles** — system configuration managed with Nix flakes.

### ✅ Portable (can be reused anywhere)
- `flake.nix` → Main flake configuration (system + modules + packages).
- `configuration.nix` → Base system configuration (users, services, desktop, etc.).

These are safe to share and can be reused on other machines (with minor adjustments).

### ⚠️ Machine-Specific (not meant to be reused)
- `hardware-configuration.nix` → Auto-generated by `nixos-generate-config`.
  - Contains hardware details (disks, drivers, UUIDs).
  - Should **not** be reused across different machines.
  - Best practice: regenerate this file on each new system.

###Repo Notes
- This repo is structured as a **dotfiles repo** for my NixOS setup.
- Some files (like `hardware-configuration.nix`) are included for completeness but may need to be excluded or regenerated elsewhere.
- Check `.gitignore` for temporary/backup files that are not tracked.

**Quick rule of thumb:**
If it defines *how I want my system to look/work*, it’s a dotfile.
If it defines *the machine’s unique hardware setup*, it’s not portable.

> This is my personal NixOS config files, usually used for debugging and backing up. I might add fastfetch if I have time.
